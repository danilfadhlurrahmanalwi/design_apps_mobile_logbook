#### Project Description
This project is an independent, self-initiated design project. I developed the design using Figma, creating a user interface that aligns with the concept and functionality of the Digital Logbook website. The design is specifically tailored for the iPhone 16 device, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly mobile experience. In addition to designing the interface, I also built an interactive prototype to demonstrate the user flow and overall functionality of the application. This project allowed me to further enhance my UI/UX design skills, particularly in mobile interface design and prototyping.
